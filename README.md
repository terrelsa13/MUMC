# Please Update To [The Lastest Version](https://github.com/terrelsa13/MUMC) Of MUMC.
* Only the default branch will receive updates.
* This branch is available for reference, but is no longer maintained.
# Version 2.1.0 And Later Are Not Backwards Compatible
* media_cleaner.py [Version 2.1.0 updates and changes](https://github.com/terrelsa13/media_cleaner/issues/23#issue-1260958344)
* Previous versions of the config are not compatible with this latest version of the script.
* If you are running an unversioned script or a version before version 2.1.0 you will need to do the following:
   - Renaming the current media_cleaner folder
   - Create a new media_cleaner folder
   - Download the updated version of the script into the new folder
   - [Manually run the script](https://github.com/terrelsa13/media_cleaner#first-run-debian-ubuntu-and-linux-mint) the first time to allow it to rebuild the config file
   - Make any manual changes to the config that are needed
   - Verify script runs as desired
   - After running as desired set `REMOVE_FILES=True`
   - If Linux set script to [run in crontab](https://github.com/terrelsa13/media_cleaner/edit/master/README.md#schedule-to-run-using-crontab-debian-ubuntu-and-linux-mint)
   - Delete the renamed folder from the first step
   - Enjoy not having to manually delete episodes, movies, audio tracks, and audio books
# Script
## media_cleaner.py
This script will go through played, favorited, and/or tagged movies, tv episodes, audio, and audiobooks for the specified user(s) and their configured libraries; deleting any media items played past the configured number of days.

# Configuration
## media_cleaner_config.py
The first time you run the script it will attempt to create the config file by asking a handful of questions.
## media_cleaner_config_defaults.py
_**Optional:**_ Before running the script for the first time; edit ```media_cleaner_config_defaults.py``` to customize the default values used to create ```media_cleaner_config.py```.
## Contents Of The Configuration File

#### Media will be deleted once it has been played the configured number of days ago:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Delete media type once it has been played # days ago
#   0-730500 - number of days to wait before deleting played media
#  -1 - to disable managing specified media type
# (-1 : default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
played_age_movie=-1
played_age_episode=-1
played_age_audio=-1
played_age_audiobook=-1
```
#### When enabled, media will not be deleted if it is marked as a favorite:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Decide if media set as a favorite should be deleted
# Favoriting a series, season, or network-channel will treat all child episodes as if they are favorites
# Favoriting an artist, album-artist, or album will treat all child tracks as if they are favorites
# Similar logic applies for other media types (movies, audio books, etc...)
#  0 - ok to delete media items set as a favorite
#  1 - when single user - do not delete media items when set as a favorite; when multi-user - do not delete media item when all monitored users have set it as a favorite
#  2 - when single user - not applicable; when multi-user - do not delete media item when any monitored users have it set as a favorite
# (1 : default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
keep_favorites_movie=1
keep_favorites_episode=1
keep_favorites_audio=1
keep_favorites_audiobook=1
```
#### Option for determining if a media item should be deleted or kept based on other users whitelisted libraries:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Decide how whitelists with multiple users behave
#  0 - do not delete media item when ALL monitored users have the parent library whitelisted
#  1 - do not delete media item when ANY monitored users have the parent library whitelisted
# (1 : default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
multiuser_whitelist_movie=1
multiuser_whitelist_episode=1
multiuser_whitelist_audio=1
multiuser_whitelist_audiobook=1
```
#### Blacktag a media item to be deleted after it is watched:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# User entered blacktag name; chosen during setup
#  Use a comma ',' to seperate multiple tag names
#   Ex: tagname,tag name,tag-name
#  Backslash '\' not allowed
#----------------------------------------------------------#
blacktag='black_tagname,black_tag name,black_tag-name'
```
#### When enabled, blacktagged media will not be deleted until ALL users have watched it:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Decide when blacktagged media items are deleted
#  0 - ok to delete blacktagged media item after ANY monitored user has watched it
#  1 - ok to delete blacktagged media item after ALL monitored users have watched it
# (0 : default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
delete_blacktagged_movie=0
delete_blacktagged_episode=0

#  Use a comma ',' to seperate multiple tag names
#   Ex: tagname,tag name,tag-name
#  Backslash '\' not allowed
#----------------------------------------------------------#
whitetag='white_tagname,white_tag name,white_tag-name'
```
#### Deleting media items is disabled by default:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Must be a boolean True or False value
#  False - Disables the ability to delete media (dry run mode)
#  True - Enable the ability to delete media
# (False : default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
REMOVE_FILES=False
```
#### At least this many episodes will reamain in each tv series:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Decide the minimum number of episodes to remain in all tv series'
# Keeping one or more epsiodes for each series allows the "Next Up"
#  functionality to notify user(s) when a new episode for a series
#  is ready to be watched
#  0 - Episodes will be deleted as they are watched

api_query_attempts=4
```
#### Throttle how aggressively the script sends queries
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# API query item limit
# To keep the server running smoothly we do not want it to return a
#  large amount of metadata from a single API query
# If the server lags or bogs down when this script runs try lowering
#  this value to allow the server to return smaller amounts of data
# ALL media items and their metadata are processed regardless of this value
#  1-10000 - maximum number of media items the server will return for each API query
#  (50 : default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
api_query_item_limit=50
```
#### DEBUG
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Must be a boolean True or False value
# False - Debug messages disabled
# True - Debug messages enabled
# (False : default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
DEBUG=False
```
#
# Requirements
* Linux or Windows
   - Mac - I do not have a Mac to confirm
   - If someone has confirmed this works on Mac, let me know and I will update this.
* Python 3.10
   - Older versions of python 3.x will likely work; but are not supported
   - Python 2.x or earlier are not supported and will not work
* python-dateutil \***must** be installed\*
* media_cleaner_config_defaults.py **\*new\***
* Emby/Jellyfin need to have permissions on Linux machines to delete media items (read from [this post](https://github.com/clara-j/media_cleaner/issues/2#issuecomment-547319398) down)

# Delete Or Keep Priorities Of A Played Media Item

At least one monitored user must have played the media item before it will be considered for deletion.<sup>1</sup>

1. **Favorites & Whitetags** (Highest Priority)
   - *media item will be kept*
      - Blacktags ignored
      - Whitelists ignored
      - Blacklists ignored
2. **Blacktags**
   - *media item will be deleted*
      - Whitelists ignored
      - Blacklists ignored
3. **Whitelists**
   - *media item will be kept*
      - Blacklists ignored
4. **Blacklists** (Lowest priority)
   - *media item will be deleted*

<sup>1</sup> If max_age_* is enabled both the media item's 'Creation Date' and 'Played State' are used.
