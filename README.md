# Known Jellfin API Authorization Updates
* Jellfyin has modified the [authorization method](https://gist.github.com/nielsvanvelzen/ea047d9028f676185832e51ffaf12a6f) and depreciated common methods used in MUMC to allow both Emby and Jellyfin to use the same URL requests.
* I am working on getting MUMC updated to the new Jellyfin authorization methods.
* Until then, there will be API calls for Jellyfin that do not work.
* All Emby API calls should continue to work.

# Multi-User Media Cleaner
Multi-User Media Cleaner aka MUMC (pronounced Mew-Mick) will query your Emby/Jellyfin server for the movies, tv episodes, audio tracks, and audiobooks in your libraries. Then delete media items you no longer want taking up disk space.
