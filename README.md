# Support For MUMC v3.x.x Ending 2023 March 31st.
* Recommend moving to [MUMC v4.x.x](https://github.com/terrelsa13/MUMC/tree/MUMC_v4-BETA)

# Multi-User Media Cleaner
Multi-User Media Cleaner aka MUMC (pronounced Mew-Mick) will go through movies, tv episodes, audio tracks, and audiobooks in your Emby/Jellyfin libraries and delete media items you no longer want taking up disk space.
# What Files Are Included?
## mumc.py
This is the main file. Without it you would still be looking for ways to automatically delete the media items you no longer want hanging around.
## mumc_config_defaults.py
_**Optional:**_ Before running the script for the first time; you can edit this file to customize the default values used when ```mumc_config.py``` is created. But do not worry if you forget to do this, you can always manually edit ```mumc_config.py``` after it is created.
# Configuration
## mumc_config.py
```mumc_config.py```, also referred to as the _configuration file_, is created the first time the script runs. Once it has been cretaed it will be what you edit to configure MUMC to delete the media items you want it to delete and keep the media items you want to keep.
# Cool! How Do I Use This?
## Step 1: What is a Filter Statement?

* A Filter Statement is a simple way to tell the script how to find and delete media items taking up your disk space.
  - This also means the media items **not matching** the Filter Statement are kept safe for watching later.
## Step 2: The basics of building a generic Filter Statement.

Generic Filter Statement Parts (each media type has their own Filter Statement Parts):
* **Part #1** - Condition Days
* **Part #2** - Played Count Inequality
* **Part #3** - Played Count

Starting with a generic Filter Statement:
* Delete media items Played/Created at least **Part #1** days ago with a played count **Part #2** **Part #3**.

  - Example A: Filling in the blanks for a generic media items _played_ Filter Statement:
    - Part #1** - **60**
    - Part #2** - **>=**
    - Part #3** - **1**
      - Delete media items _played_ at least **60** days ago with a played count **>=** **1**.

  - Example B: Filling in the blanks for a generic media items _created_ Filter Statement:
    - Part #1 - **3650**
    - Part #2 - **<**
    - Part #3 - **2**
      - Delete media items _created_ at least **3650** days ago with a played count **<** **2**.
## Step 3: Building Filter Statements for specific media types.

* Delete movies played at least **22** days ago with a played count **>=** **1**.
  - movie_played_days=22
  - movie_played_count_comparison='>='
  - movie_played_count=1

* Delete episodes played at least **55** days ago with a played count **not <=** **0**.
  - episode_played_days=55
  - episode_played_count_comparison='not <='
  - episode_played_count=0

* Delete audio tracks played at least **123** days ago with a played count **==** **4**.
  - audio_played_days=123
  - audio_played_count_comparison='=='
  - audio_played_count=4

* Delete episodes created at least **3456** days ago with a played count **>** **0**.
  - episode_created_days=3456
  - episode_created_played_count_comparison='>'
  - episode_created_played_count=0

* Delete movies created at least **4567** days ago with a played count **not ==** **0**.
  - movie_created_days=4567
  - movie_created_played_count_comparison='not =='
  - movie_created_played_count=0

* Delete audio tracks created at least **5678** days ago with a played count **not >=** **11**.
  - audio_created_days=5678
  - audio_created_played_count_comparison='not >='
  - audio_created_played_count=11

There are many possible combinations!

## Step 4: The dangers of ill-thought-out Filter Statements.
You are **SOLEY RESPONSIBLE** if you misconfigure your Filter Statement and delete large portions of your library. I recommend staying in dry-run mode until you are certain things are working exactly as you want them to.
#### !!!DANGEROUS Filter Examples Below BEWARE!!!
What you **_NEVER_** want to do is to set ```*_created_days=TO_SOME_LOW_NUMBER```.
Doing this WILL delete MOST if not ALL of your library.

##### Never do this unless you are 1000% confident it is doing exactly what you expect:
* Delete movies created at least **0** days ago...
  - movie_created_days=0
  - ...

* Delete episodes created at least **1** day ago...
  - episode_created_days=1
  - ...

* Delete audio track created at least **2** days ago...
  - audio_created_days=2
  - ...

* Delete movie created at least **3** days ago...
  - movie_created_days=3
  - ...

You get the point right?

## Step 5: A couple things to remember when building Filter Statements

Filter Statements implying negative played counts will be evaluted as ```*_played_count=0``` (i.e. unplayed media items).

* ...with a played count **<** **0**.
  - ...
  - episode_played_count_comparison='<'
  - episode_played_count=0

* ...with a played count **not >=** **0**.
  - ...
  - movie_created_played_count_comparison='not >='
  - movie_created_played_count=0

_Played_ Filter Statements overlapping zero and postive numbered played counts will only delete the media items with postive numbered played counts (i.e. the played media items).

* Delete episodes played at least # days ago with a played count **<=** **1**.
  - ...
  - episode_played_count_comparison='<='
  - episode_played_count=1

* Delete movies played at least # days ago with a played count **>=** **0**.
  - ...
  - movie_played_count_comparison='>='
  - movie_played_count=0

## Step 6: Example Filter Statements

#### Filter Statement to delete movies played 90 or more days ago.

* Delete movies played at least **90** days ago with a played count **>=** **1**.
  - movie_played_days=90
  - movie_played_count_comparison='>='
  - movie_played_count=1

#### Filter Statement to delete episodes played less than twice, 30 or more days ago.

* Delete episodes played at least **30** days ago with a played count **<** **2**.
  - episode_played_days=30
  - episode_played_count_comparison='<'
  - episode_played_count=2

#### Filter Statement to delete "old" played and unplayed movies.

* Delete movies created at least **365** days ago with a played count **>=** **0**.
  - movie_created_days=365
  - movie_created_played_count_comparison='>='
  - movie_created_played_count=0

#### Filter Statement to delete "old" unplayed episodes.

* Delete episodes created at least **365** days ago with a played count **==** **0**.
  - episode_created_days=365
  - episode_created_played_count_comparison='=='
  - episode_created_played_count=0

#### Filter Statement to delete "old" played episodes.

* Delete episodes created at least **365** days ago with a played count **not ==** **0**.
  - episode_created_days=365
  - episode_created_played_count_comparison='not =='
  - episode_created_played_count=0

### Using Both Played And Created Filter Statements Together:
#### Filter Statement to delete movies played exactly once, 60 or more days ago.
#### Combined with...
#### Filter Statement to delete unplayed movies created 180 or more days ago.

* Delete movies played at least **60** days ago with a played count **==** **1**.
  - movie_played_days=60
  - movie_played_count_comparison='=='
  - movie_played_count=1

* Delete movies created at least **180** days ago with a played count **==** **0**.
  - movie_created_days=180
  - movie_created_played_count_comparison='=='
  - movie_created_played_count=0

### Advanced Configuration File Variables
#### Option for determining if a media item should be deleted or kept based on individual users' or all users' play counts:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Decide how play count with multiple users will behave
#  0 - ok to delete media item when ANY monitored users meet the
#      *_play_count_comparison and *_play_count

# (0 : default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
multiuser_play_count_movie=0
multiuser_play_count_episode=0
multiuser_play_count_audio=0
multiuser_play_count_audiobook=0
```
#### Option for determining if a media item should be deleted or kept based on individual users' or all users' played days:
```python

multiuser_play_days_episode=1
multiuser_play_days_audio=0
multiuser_play_days_audiobook=0
```
#### When enabled, media will not be deleted if it is marked as a favorite:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Decide if media set as a favorite should be deleted
# Favoriting a series, season, or network-channel will treat all child episodes as if they are favorites
# Favoriting an artist, album-artist, or album will treat all child tracks as if they are favorites
# Similar logic applies for other media types (movies, audio books, etc...)
#  0 - ok to delete media items set as a favorite
#  1 - when single user - do not delete media items when set as a favorite; when multi-user - do not delete media item when all monitored users have set it as a favorite
#  2 - when single user - not applicable; when multi-user - do not delete media item when any monitored users have it set as a favorite
# (1 : default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
keep_favorites_movie=1
keep_favorites_episode=1
keep_favorites_audio=1
keep_favorites_audiobook=1
```
#### Option for determining if a media item should be deleted or kept based on other users' whitelisted libraries:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Decide how whitelists with multiple users behave
#  0 - do not delete media item when ANY monitored users have the parent library whitelisted
#  1 - do not delete media item when ALL monitored users have the parent library whitelisted
# (0 : default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
multiuser_whitelist_movie=0
multiuser_whitelist_episode=0
multiuser_whitelist_audio=0
multiuser_whitelist_audiobook=0
```
#### Blacktag a media item to be deleted after it is played:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# User entered blacktag name; chosen during setup
#  Use a comma ',' to seperate multiple tag names
#   Ex: tagname,tag name,tag-name
#  Backslash '\' not allowed
#----------------------------------------------------------#
blacktag='black_tagname,black_tag name,black_tag-name'
```
#### When enabled, blacktagged media will not be deleted until ALL users have played it:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Decide when blacktagged media items are deleted
#  0 - ok to delete blacktagged media item after ANY monitored user has played it
#  1 - ok to delete blacktagged media item after ALL monitored users have played it
# (0 : default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
delete_blacktagged_movie=0
delete_blacktagged_episode=0
delete_blacktagged_audio=0
delete_blacktagged_audiobook=0
```
#### Whitetag a media item to be kept after it is played:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# User entered whitetag name; chosen during setup
#  Use a comma ',' to seperate multiple tag names
#   Ex: tagname,tag name,tag-name
#  Backslash '\' not allowed
#----------------------------------------------------------#
whitetag='white_tagname,white_tag name,white_tag-name'
```
#### At least this many episodes will remain in each tv series; Does not care about played or unplayed states:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Decide the minimum number of episodes to remain in all tv series'
# This value applies to both played and unplayed episodes
#  0 - Episodes will be deleted based on the Filter Statement
#  1-730500 - Episodes will be deleted based on the Filter Statement; unless
#              the remaining played and unplayed episodes are less than or equal
#              to the chosen value
# (0 : default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
minimum_number_episodes=0
```
#### At least this many played episodes will remain in each tv series:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Decide the minimum number of played episodes to remain in all tv series'
# Keeping one or more played epsiodes for each series allows the "Next Up"
#  functionality to notify user(s) when a new episode for a series
#  is available
# This value applies only to played and episodes
#  0 - Episodes will be deleted based on the Filter Statement
#  1-730500 - Episodes will be deleted based on the Filter Statement; unless
#              the remaining played episodes are less than or equal to the
#              chosen value
# (0 : default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
minimum_number_played_episodes=0
```
#### Set the behavior of ```minimum_number_episodes``` and/or ```minimum_number_played_episodes```:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Decide how 'minimum_number_episodes' and 'minimum_number_played_episodes' will behave
# The minimum number of played and unplayed episodes will vary for each user and for each
#  series when multiple users are playing the same series at different paces.
# The following option gives a mechanism to control this in different ways.
# The 'minimum_number_episodes' and 'minimum_number_played_episodes' will be based off of...
#  'User's Name' - The UserName specified; If matching UserName not found script will assume default.
#  'User's Id' - The UserId specified; If matching UserName not found script will assume default.
#  'Max Played' - The first user with the highest number of played episodes to be deleted for each series.
#  'Min Played' - The first user with the lowest number of played episodes to be deleted for each series.
#  'Max Unplayed' - The first user with the highest number of unplayed episodes to be deleted for each series.
#  'Min Unplayed' - The first user with the lowest number of unplayed episodes to be deleted for each series.
# The Max/Min Played/Unplayed values can be mixed and matched. For example...
#  'Max Unplayed Min Played' - The number played episodes to be deleted is based off the user
#                                with the highest number of unplayed episodes to be deleted for a
#                                specified series. The number of unplayed episodes to be deleted is
#                                based off the user with the lowest number of played episodes to be
#                                deleted for a specified series.
# ('Min Played Min Unplayed' : default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
minimum_number_episodes_behavior='Min Played Min Unplayed'
```
#### Deleting media items is disabled by default:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#

### Automatically Created Configuration File Variables
```python
#---------!!!DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING BELOW!!!----------------#
# These are automatically created during setup.
#   If you do not know EXACTLY what you are doing, changing these
#      can and will cause script failure.
#   The only way to recover from script failure is to revert the
#      config back to the way it was OR rebuilding a new config.
#----------------------------------------------------------#
```
#### Needed for differences between Emby and Jellyfin
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Server branding; chosen during setup

#  1 - 'jellyfin'
#----------------------------------------------------------#
server_brand='serverbrand'
```
#### Full URL of media server
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Server URL; created during setup
#----------------------------------------------------------#
server_url='http://localhost.abc:8096/basename'
```
#### Server authentication key

```
#### How were libraries selected during setup?
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Decide how the script will use the libraries chosen for each user
#  Only used during creation or editing of the configuration file
#  0 - blacklist - Chosen libraries will be blacklisted

#### How will media items be matched to their respective libraries?
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Decide how the script will match media items to the blacklisted and whiteliested libraries
#  0 - byId - Media items will be matched to libraries using 'LibraryIds'
#  1 - byPath - Media items will be matched to libraries using 'Paths'
#  2 - byNetworkPath - Media items will be matched to libraries using 'NetworkPaths'
# Filtering byId does not apply to the rules below.
# Filtering byPath requires no shared network folders are configured.
#  When this is true Emby/Jellyfin return a path for each media item.
# Filtering byNetworkPath requires shared network folders are configured.
#  When this is true Emby/Jellyfin return a newtork path for each media item.

#### Number of times to send an API query before giving up
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# API query attempts
# Number of times to retry an API request
#  Delay between initial attempt and the first retry is 1 second
#  The delay will double with each attempt after the first retry
#  Delay between the orginal request and retry #1 is (2^0) 1 second
#  Delay between retry #1 and retry #2 is (2^1) 2 seconds
#  Delay between retry #2 and retry #3 is (2^2) 4 seconds
#  Delay between retry #3 and retry #4 is (2^3) 8 seconds
#  Delay between retry #4 and retry #5 is (2^4) 16 seconds
#  Delay between retry #5 and retry #6 is (2^5) 32 seconds
#  ...
#  Delay between retry #15 and retry #16 is (2^15) 32768 seconds
#  0-16 - number of retry attempts
#  (4 : default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
api_query_attempts=4
```
#### Throttle how aggressively the script sends queries
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# API query item limit
# To keep the server running smoothly we do not want it to return a
#  large amount of metadata from a single API query
# If the server lags or bogs down when this script runs try lowering
#  this value to allow the server to return smaller amounts of data
# ALL media items and their metadata are processed regardless of this value
#  1-10000 - maximum number of media items the server will return for each API query
#  (25 : default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
api_query_item_limit=25
```
#### Amount of RAM used for caching API requests
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# API cache maximum size
# This is a crude FIFO RAM cache
# To keep the script running efficiently we do not want to send the
#  same requests to the server repeatedly
# If the script is running slowly during media item collection for each user try
#  increasing the cache size
# Recommend NOT to exceed more than 20% of the server's total RAM
# If the cache is smaller than any single reponse, that response will
#  not be cached
# During testing on the developlment server, 1MB of cache is better
#  than 0MB of cache
# It is recommened to disable the cache if the server is not able to
#  spare an extra 1MB of RAM
#
# MegaByte Sizing Reference
#  1MB = 1048576 Bytes
#  1000MB = 1GB
#  10000MB = 10GB
#
#  0 - Disable cache
#  1-10000 - Size of cache in megabytes (MB)
#  (20 : default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
api_query_cache_size=20
```
#### DEBUG
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Must be a boolean True or False value or an integer 0 thru 4
#  Debug log file save to: /the/script/directory/mumc_DEBUG.log
#  The debug log file can be large (i.e. 10s to 100s of MBytes)
#  Recommend only enabling DEBUG when necessary
#  False - Debug messages disabled
#   0 - Debug messages disabled
#  True - Level 1 debug messages enabled
#   1 - Level 1 debug messaging enabled
#   2 - Level 2 debug messaging enabled
#   3 - Level 3 debug messaging enabled
#   4 - Level 4 debug messaging enabled
# (0 : default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
DEBUG=0

# Library Matching By Id, By Path, or By Network Path
* [Explaination and examples.](https://github.com/terrelsa13/MUMC/issues/18#issue-1217953189)

# Known Limitations
* When importing played states from Trakt the ```days since played``` shown in the console output will not show the correct value.
  - This is an issue with the ```last played date``` not being filled in when played states are imported from Trakt to Emby/Jellyfin.
  - The script is able to compensate for this using the [```*_set_missing_last_played_date```](https://github.com/terrelsa13/MUMC/#add-lastplayeddate-for-media-items-without-it) options.

# Requirements
* Linux, Windows, or MAC
   - I do not have a Mac to confirm; but should be similiar to Linux
* Python 3.10
   - Older versions of python 3.x will likely work; but are not supported
   - Python 2.x or earlier are not supported and will not work
* python-dateutil **must be installed**
* Emby/Jellyfin need to have OS level permissions on Linux machines to delete media items: [Read This Post](https://github.com/terrelsa13/MUMC/issues/28#issue-1293649223)

# First Run (Debian, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint)
* Install Python version mentioned in the 'Requirements' section above
  - If this version of Python is not already installed do NOT overwrite the defaul OS Python version
  - Instead use the link below to create an alternate install of Python
    - [Python 3.7 example](https://tecadmin.net/install-python-3-7-on-ubuntu-linuxmint/) (These instructions will apply to any version of Python.)
* Verify your Python verison
   - $```python3 -V```
* Next install the python-dateutil module with the following commands:
   - $```sudo apt-get upgrade -y```
   - $```sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y```
   - $```pip3 install -U pip```
   - $```pip3 install python-dateutil```
* **\*OPTIONAL\*** Use a text editor to update the mumc_config_defaults.py file with desired default values
   - $```nano /path/to/mumc_config_defaults.py```
* Make the script executable
   - $```chmod +x /path/to/mumc.py```
* Run the script
   - $```/path/to/python3.x /path/to/mumc.py```
* First time the script is run, it will walk through creating the mumc_config.py file
* If you get the below python error the python-dateutil module was not properly installed
   - ```ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dateutil' python-dateutil```

# First Run (Windows)
* Download the latest [MUMC.zip](https://github.com/terrelsa13/MUMC/releases/latest)
* Move the MUMC.zip to your user's directory (below path assumes your username is Zoomies)
  - ```C:\Users\Zoomies```
* Extract MUMC.zip
  - There should now be a MUMC folder
  - ```C:\Users\Zoomies\MUMC```
* Next go to https://www.python.org/ and install the python version shown in the [Requirements section](https://github.com/terrelsa13/MUMC#requirements)
* After python is installed; open a command window
  - Select: The Start Menu
  - Type: ```cmd```
  - Press: ```Enter``` key
* Using the command window, install the python-dateutil module
  - Type: ```pip install python-dateutil```
* After the python-dateutil module is installed keep the command window open
* Change current working directory of the command window to the ```C:\Users\Zoomies\MUMC``` folder using the command below
  - Type: cd ```C:\Users\Zoomies\MUMC```
* Now run the script in the command window using the command below
  - Type: ```python mumc.py```
  - Follow the script prompts
    - First time the script is run, it will walk through creating the ```mumc_config.py``` file in ```C:\Users\Zoomies\MUMC``` folder
* After the ```mumc_config.py``` file is created it can be edited in a text editor (e.g. Notepad, Notepad++, Visual Studio, UltraEdit, etc...)
* Once ```mumc_config.py``` is configured as desired, run the script again using the same command from above
  - Type: ```python mumc.py```

# First Run (Other Operating Systems)
* Please consult your favorite search engine

# Schedule To Run Using Crontab (Debian, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint)
* Below cron entry runs ```mumc.py``` everyday at 00:00hrs (aka 12:00am)
   - $```0 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/python3.10 /opt/mumc/mumc.py```
* Below cron entry runs ```mumc.py``` every Monday at 01:23hrs (aka 1:23)am and saves the output to a file called mumc.log in the /var/log/ directory
   - $```23 1 * * 1 /usr/local/bin/python3.10 /opt/mumc/mumc.py > /var/log/mumc.log 2>&1```
